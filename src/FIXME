2.  (done) Fix combotree drawing

8. (done) Add callback to paintbrush.

10. (done) Fix barchart to use paintbrush and/or background.

11. (done) Does it make sense to separate out picture text drawing into a
    module?  Separate file yes. Module?  FreeType is already used in
    bltUnixFont.c but not in bltWinFont.c. Don't require Window users to
    link with freetype.

15. (done) Remove Makefile.vc and Makefile.bc files.

14. Clean up pictdraw routines.  Separate out working from experimental.
